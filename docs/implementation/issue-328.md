# Issue 328 qualification evidence

Status: incomplete. All six issues #323–328 and parent #322 remain open.
The live #328 body was read on 2026-10-17; its last update was
2026-10-17T21:46:31Z. This report does not replace its acceptance criteria.

The Linux candidate is in `/tmp/hulymcp-resident-linux`, branch
`implement/resident-mcp-linux-323-328`. The latest production checkpoint is
`b3a3fc5c`; the subsequent normal-stop/concurrent-replacement increment changes
only fixtures and reports. [Issue 327](issue-327.md#linux-packaged-stop-and-concurrent-normal-replacement-2026-10-17)
records exact MCP/CLI artifact hashes, the redacted receipt and preserved attempts.
It independently joins kernel-owned exits rather than inferring retirement from
CLI acceptance or missing metadata.

## Acceptance evidence index

Rows follow the 15 criteria in the current GitHub issue, in order. Partial
evidence leaves the criterion pending.

| Criterion | Current evidence and remaining work |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Complete contract, coherent final gate and local Huly | Earlier gates and focused increments are recorded in #323–327 reports. The final coherent candidate gate and deferred live-Huly campaign remain pending. |
| 2. Native lifecycle/concurrency/platform scenarios | Linux normal stop, two-caller replacement and version coexistence have process receipts. The ten-parent race has preserved inconsistent results. Complete Linux schedules and native macOS/Windows remain pending. |
| 3. Windows detachment, ACL and cleanup | Pending. Current POSIX ownership protection refuses unsupported native Windows execution; that is not Windows implementation or qualification. |
| 4. Auth/profile/policy/protocol behavior | Synthetic environment-token workspaces and actual catalog/context exchange support scoped fixtures. Complete supported profile/env/token/password, policy and modern/legacy qualification remains pending. |
| 5. Actual host discovery and continued reads | Programmatic pinned MCP client parents exercise the packaged adapter. Naming clients after hosts is not actual application-host discovery. Native host evidence remains pending. |
| 6. Alternating fresh-process comparisons | Pending for standalone, managed and direct HTTP with one/ten clients and declared cache boundaries. |
| 7. Total RSS/CPU/completion rates | Pending. No prior direct-HTTP memory figure is adopted as a managed-stdio budget. Include every actual adapter, launcher and backend. |
| 8. Adversarial routing/backpressure/no replay | Existing scoped routing/request-loss evidence and the [operation-stop fault schedules](issue-327.md#stop-during-an-operation-and-failed-cleanup-2026-10-17) prove scoped local behavior. The latter use an embedded registry and one filesystem write with explicit host cancellation. The [detectable namespace-loss schedules](issue-327.md#refuse-detectable-ownership-state-loss-before-selection-2026-10-17) additionally cover five local metadata faults with a live existing caller. Complete real-Huly fault qualification remains pending. |
| 9. Quint and aligned oracle scenarios | The newer lifecycle model is type-only awaiting its recorded sketch checkpoint. Full lifecycle logic, checks and observed scenario alignment remain pending. |
| 10. Per-platform receipts and cleanup | Linux receipts include source/artifact evidence and owned exit checks. Complete platform receipts, preserved failures and all cleanup suffixes remain pending. |
| 11. Operational launch/status/stop/recovery/upgrade guidance | [Manual](../resident-manual.md), status/stop help and generated CLI skill document current behavior. Acceptance explicitly leaves retirement unconfirmed. Final supported-path audit remains pending. |
| 12. Prototype/artifact cleanup after qualification | Not yet due: production integration and complete qualification have not occurred. Preserve the prototype and useful evidence. |
| 13. Local/remote prototype branch deletion | Not yet due. Inspect dirty work and unmerged commits, preserve useful work, then record deletion only after integration/qualification. |
| 14. Keep cleanup in scope | No prototype, unrelated branch or artifact cleanup was performed by this increment. Final delivery audit remains pending. |
| 15. Complete-contract delivery decision | Pending. No subset pass closes this ticket or parent. |

Live Huly runs remain deferred until all six implementation slices are integrated,
as instructed by the user. No publishing, default promotion, OS service, global
host configuration change or prototype deletion is authorized by these receipts.
The current recovery policy has no durable operation journal or automatic replay;
unresolved owner loss remains bounded refusal until verified local retirement.

## Ten-parent launch diagnosis (2026-10-17, continued)

At production checkpoint `39c2339b`, the unchanged ten-parent process suite
failed again before any parent completed connection. All ten parent phase logs
reached their existing five-second connection limit. The preserved run is
`/tmp/resident-ten-parent-current-diagnosis.log`, SHA-256
`3fd5b9c76e1ebf8e0f4fd8cfc9d4aaafd330a79555792fe8bab589d17931c46d`;
its isolated bundle remains `dist/stdio-suite-ddJSdZ`.

A separate scratch copy added file markers before and after bundle evaluation,
without changing deadlines or callers. That run completed, with evidence under
`/tmp/resident-ten-parent-stages-etcvx1ug`. It changes the artifact and therefore
is diagnostic evidence only, not production qualification. Its success does not
explain the preceding failure or establish that bundle evaluation is the cause.
The SDK disposable version-probe process suppresses stderr, so existing parent
logs do not identify the internal connection stage responsible for the failure.

The process test now also saves its private phases log on subprocess failure,
instead of saving it only on success. Publication failure emits a static warning
and preserves the original subprocess exception. The subsequent focused run
passed with the unchanged deadlines and all ten callers; log
`/tmp/resident-ten-parent-retained-diagnostics.log`, SHA-256
`2fe60c45ed5b8d3e64229a6251b7d633460751740d7b99985520c92984e46ba2`,
and receipt `/tmp/resident-managed-parents-91VfaN.receipt.json`.
This passing run did not exercise the new failure-publication branch. The launch
reliability issue remains unresolved; no deadline, caller count, production path
or acceptance requirement was relaxed.

## Kernel-owned ten-parent retirement evidence (2026-10-17)

The ten-parent fixture now receives the existing supervisor's private reaped-event
pipe and joins the actual kernel-owned backend `waitpid` result. The receipt
includes `backendExit`; the test requires exit code 0 and identity equal to the
selected registry owner. PID absence is no longer the final backend-retirement
proof. Parent-loss, survivor read, ten independent clients, eleven-second hold,
and all existing response/retirement/supervision deadlines remain intact.
The observer closes in an outer finalizer, including failed runs.

The focused suite passed: `/tmp/resident-ten-parent-kernel-exit.log`, SHA-256
`bd95ef8b68d25f1cd0fd16c8c7c91695ae943c77ba1c21a501389a7a72093f53`.
Receipt `/tmp/resident-managed-parents-wq4aov.receipt.json`, SHA-256
`dcc7cd5ec8dc2825d73f4003258c3598d5c888af41a161be599fe70a7d568e34`,
records the matching owned exit with code 0 and complete private-state removal.
TypeScript/Effect diagnostics and focused lint passed. Read-only Spec review
reported no actionable findings.

A scratch shell wrapper also captured disposable probe stderr under
`/tmp/resident-probe-stderr-4isluebc`; that diagnostic run passed and its twenty
probe/session stderr files were empty. It does not identify the cause of the
earlier connection timeout. This change strengthens retirement evidence only;
launch reliability, complete platform qualification and final integration remain
pending. No production code or recovery policy changed.
