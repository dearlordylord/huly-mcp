# Issue 327 implementation evidence

This is an incomplete candidate under #322. No criterion or issue is accepted by
this report alone. The shared implementation remains in
`/tmp/hulymcp-resident-linux` on `implement/resident-mcp-linux-323-328`.

## Current refusal and uncertainty policy

Startup does not signal a PID from registry metadata. A parent can terminate its
own prepared `ChildProcess` before attempting Start. It consumes that authority
before attempting the private Start send and never restores it after a failed
send, cancellation or lost readiness. An authorized child owns its own lifetime.

Selection treats unavailable current owners, corrupt state, unresolved claims and
multiple compatible live owners as refusal. This candidate does not yet implement
verified crash replacement. Registry retirement requires an owned receipt and the
original device/inode; failed or pending application cleanup retains publication.
PID absence alone does not establish descendant retirement.

The adapter never automatically retries an MCP operation. Encoding refusal before
HTTP execution reports non-dispatch. A failed connection, incomplete reply or
disconnected response can leave the operation outcome unknown. A new healthy
generation cannot reconcile that old operation. The caller must retain its
uncertainty and use an operation-specific read/reconciliation contract before
deciding what to do next. No general exactly-once guarantee is made.

Current compatibility requires the exact package implementation version and the
captured Huly authority, policy and generation. Known incompatible registry
versions remain opaque and can coexist within the bounded inventory. Unknown
registry formats block selection. Registry coexistence tests do not establish
native coexistence of two separately installed package versions or a migration
protocol; those remain pending.

## Committed-write response loss

`test/resident/uncertain-write-process.test.ts` drives the packaged manual adapter
over actual authenticated TLS. A disposable fixture commits a private file write,
then loses its response either before headers or after the host observes a progress
notification. The second schedule uses an explicit fault callback after observed
progress, rather than a timing delay. Independent file parsing confirms one commit,
and the fixture counts one dispatch. The adapter exits with no terminal reply and
with an unknown-outcome/no-replay diagnostic. Owned child handles are joined, the
listener is closed, and failed bundles are retained.

The after-progress case first fails because the diagnostic says only
`Backend response disconnected` (`/tmp/resident-uncertain-stream-write-red.log`).
The adapter now includes the unknown-outcome and no-replay wording on that path.
The fixed two-schedule fixture and nearby adapter boundary tests pass, 16 tests
(`/tmp/resident-uncertain-stream-write-green.log`). This fixture demonstrates
response loss after a disposable mutation; it does not
simulate backend process death or establish live Huly reconciliation.

## Remaining qualification

Complete crash timing schedules, verified replacement with concurrent callers,
late acquisitions and descendant inventory, reused-PID/foreign-listener refusal,
two-installed-version coexistence, and failure isolation across configurations.
Align observed transitions with the approved lifecycle model and record its safety
domain and liveness assumptions separately. The new model remains a type-only
sketch awaiting approval. Final live Huly write/reconciliation and native-platform
qualification remain pending. The combined Linux checkpoint passes `pnpm check-all`
with 454 files and 5,632 tests at the unchanged thresholds
(`/tmp/resident-lifecycle-boundaries-frozen-check-all.log`). Fresh combined Standards
and Spec reviews report no actionable defect in staged tree
`b5ed29cd8cd11336fa2430a6e835ed327824a3e9`; neither accepts any issue as complete.
